# KIER-FREE-Training
This repository contains the training material for the 2020 FREE-KIER collaborative training session. The training session is intended to transfer knowledge regarding 'solar city' analysis options and methodologies. The training session consists of 5x 1-hour sessions. Each session takes up a particular component of the overall mission of the training. The following components are addressed:

1. Session introducing the tools and software commonly used for the purposes of 'solar city' analysis.
2. Preliminary overview of methods and options to evaluate 'solar city' potential.
3. Detailed methodological overview, Part 1: GIS-based assessment methods.
4. Detailed methodological overview, Part 2: LIDAR-based assessment methods.
5. Conclusion and summary.

The sessions are conducted virtually. To that end, each session is accompanied by one or more 'Jupyter Notebooks' that can be run remotely. In other words, there is no need to download specific software, data, or programs locally as the training session will be entirely operated on a remote server using the Binder ecosystem. 

The analysis is done almost entirely using the Python programming language. In some cases, LaTex, HTML, Java, or Markdown are used as well to illustrate specific components. 

The following notebooks make up the training session:

1. Index.
2.
